## Symlinking  
All the extensions are organized so that you can symlink them to your Joomla! installation. This allows you to keep all your extensions code in one place but spread it out across multiple folders in your Joomla! install.   

You can manually symlink the folders but I highly recommend you install the nooku-symlinker. It cuts down 2-3 commands into one. It's available at http://www.nooku.org/framework.html      

*I'll try to write more docs here soon* I needed some blank extensions for tests and thought I'd share.
